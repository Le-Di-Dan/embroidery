# APP3 — Design Templates and 2D Design Studio

## 1. Outcome

Deliver the product differentiation core: Admin defines versioned product-compatible embroidery templates and customers create a validated, watermark-protected 2D customization session.

## 2. Dependencies

APP2 complete; APP0 editor spike approved; design-document/design-engine ownership and serialization baseline confirmed.

## 3. Design policy

Audit prior wireframes/high-fidelity Studio work and Design System. Expected classification is `REUSE` or `SUPPLEMENT`. Missing Admin template screens and customer editor states are completed in one coherent APP3 package. No 3D or download UI.

Design, when required, is delivered as one complete phase package and is not split into coding checkpoints.

## 4. In scope

- Template create/edit/version/publish/deactivate and product compatibility.
- Embroidery areas, allowed tools/assets/fonts/colors and constraints.
- Design session create/load/update/abandon/expiry.
- Canonical design document and server validation.
- 2D preview on product images.
- Text/image layer interaction, transforms, mobile controls.
- Watermark and private asset protection.
- Autosave/recovery and version consistency.

## 5. Out of scope

- 3D previews.
- Customer download/export.
- Digitized production file generation.
- Review/approval and quotation.
- Unbounded free-form graphic editor features.

## 6. Candidate engineering checkpoints

These are planning slices. Execute and review one at a time. Any backend slice remains subject to the maximum of five tightly related HTTP endpoints.

- **APP3-C01 — Template core contract:** Define list, detail, create, update, and version/read operations.
- **APP3-B01 — Template core backend:** Implement template ownership, validation, version semantics and repository tests.
- **APP3-A01 — Admin template list:** Implement list/status/filter and navigation.
- **APP3-A02 — Admin template editor:** Implement product side/area/tool constraints and validation against the approved design.
- **APP3-C02 — Template publication contract:** Define publish, deactivate, compatibility check, and public compatible-template read operations.
- **APP3-B02 — Template publication backend:** Implement immutable/versioned publication and compatibility rules.
- **APP3-A03 — Admin template publication:** Implement readiness and lifecycle actions.
- **APP3-C03 — Design session core contract:** Define create, get, update/autosave, and abandon operations.
- **APP3-B03 — Design session backend:** Implement ownership, canonical document validation, expiry, optimistic conflict/version behavior and tests.
- **APP3-S01 — Studio route shell:** Implement server-rendered route shell, product/template bootstrap and client boundary.
- **APP3-S02 — Canvas renderer and selection:** Implement 2D render, selection and viewport using design-engine; no inline CSS positioning.
- **APP3-S03 — Text layer capability:** Implement add/edit/style text within approved constraints.
- **APP3-S04 — Image layer capability:** Implement approved asset/image placement within constraints.
- **APP3-S05 — Transform capability:** Implement move/resize/rotate, bounds, keyboard/touch behavior and accessible fallback where feasible.
- **APP3-S06 — Watermark and preview:** Implement consistent watermark and non-exportable customer preview.
- **APP3-S07 — Autosave and recovery:** Implement pending/saved/error/conflict/expired recovery behavior.
- **APP3-E01 — Studio E2E:** Published template → customer creates session → customizes → autosaves → reloads → server rejects invalid out-of-bounds/tampered document.
- **APP3-X01 — Phase closure:** Close R2 Customization Alpha and hand off session/customer secure journey needs to APP4.

## 7. Critical end-to-end journey

Admin publishes a template compatible with a published product. A customer starts a 2D session, adds text/image within limits, sees watermark, autosaves, reloads the session, and cannot submit tampered geometry or access private production assets.

## 8. Exit gate

- Canonical design document remains independent of React/canvas library.
- Server validates critical editor constraints.
- Template versions explain existing sessions.
- Mobile critical interactions pass.
- No 3D/download scope appears.
- E2E passes.

## 9. Handoff

APP4/APP5 may associate verified customer/contact and request records with valid design sessions without changing editor ownership.
